SHA-256 is designed to be a one-way cryptographic function.
It takes an input and produces a fixed-length hash value, but the process cannot be reversed.
This is a core feature of hash functions, making them secure for use in data integrity and password storage.

Simplified Explanation of SHA-256
What is SHA-256?
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) is a cryptographic tool used to convert any input data into a fixed-size output called a hash. The result is a unique 256-bit (32-byte) value, often displayed as a sequence of 64 hexadecimal characters.

How it Works:

Input: You can provide any message or data of any length.
Processing:
The message is padded with extra bits (starting with a 1, followed by zeros) to make its length a multiple of 512 bits.
The last 64 bits of this padded message store the length of the original message.
Output: The algorithm processes the data in chunks of 512 bits and generates a unique 256-bit hash value.
Key Features:

Fixed Size: Regardless of the input size, the hash is always 256 bits.
Unique Hash: Even a tiny change in the input creates a completely different hash.

Hashes like SHA-256 are intentionally designed to be irreversible. This makes them ideal for verifying data integrity, storing passwords securely (along with a salt), and ensuring message authenticity in cryptographic protocols. If you need to retrieve the original value from a hash, you'll need to look at other approaches like encryption, which is a two-way process (e.g., AES, RSA).
